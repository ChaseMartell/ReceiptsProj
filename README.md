# ReceiptsProj

This project was a coding challenge for my C++ course at my university. 
In this project, we were given 3 txt files. One of the files was the customer file that contained personal information of fake individuals. The next file was an item file that contained a list of all of the different products that the grocery store offered, along with their ID number and the price per item. The final file had orders, with their method of payment,the date, and other information such as the quantity of each individual item that the certain customer ID purchased. We had to implement all of these txt files and output a txt file of receipts for the 609 customers. In this repository I have included the individual txt files, along with the necessary C++ files to perform the work. The majority of the work occurs in the groceries.cpp file, and the receipts are output into the order_report.txt file. 

This project helped each student work on their knowledge of structs and classes, and also allowed us to work with retrieving data from files. Many of these concepts are extremely important in C++, and I loved every second of this project!
